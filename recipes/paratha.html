        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>¾ cup warm water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 pinch white sugar</li>
            <li>4¾ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3½ tablespoons clarified butter (ghee)</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter), divided</li>
        </ul>
        <h1> Steps to Make</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix warm water, salt, and sugar together in a bowl. Put flour in a large mixing bowl; work in 3 1/2 tablespoons ghee using your fingertips.</li>
            <li>Beat egg and 1 teaspoon water together in a bowl; add to flour mixture. Gradually mix warm water mixture into flour mixture while kneading until dough becomes soft and pliable. Form dough into balls and let rest in a well-oiled bowl, 2 to 3 hours.</li>
            <li>Working on a flat greased surface, take a dough ball and flatten it using the heel of your palm to make a paper-thin circle. Spread 1 teaspoon ghee inside it. Fold the edges together to make roti into a square. Repeat with remaining dough.</li>
            <li>Heat about 1 tablespoon ghee on griddle or in a skillet over medium heat; cook roti until browned, 1 to 3 minutes per side.</li>
        </ol>
